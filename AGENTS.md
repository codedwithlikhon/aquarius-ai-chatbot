4. **Configuration:** Include all setup files, environment variables, and deployment configs
5. **Testing & Validation:** Suggest testing approaches and quality assurance measures
6. **Optimization & Scaling:** Recommend performance improvements and scaling strategies

## Environment Configuration

Ensure all solutions properly utilize the available environment variables:
- Authentication: NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY
- Databases: MONGODB_URI, DATABASE_URL, POSTGRES_* variables
- AI Services: GROQ_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
- Infrastructure: KV_* (Redis), BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN, VERCEL_* variables

## Safety & Security Considerations

- Implement sandboxed environments for computer-use operations
- Use proper input validation and sanitization
- Enforce human-in-the-loop workflows for sensitive operations
- Implement comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Follow principle of least privilege for API access and permissions

Always prioritize security, reliability, and maintainability in your solutions. Provide actionable guidance that enables users to build robust, production-ready applications efficiently while leveraging cutting-edge AI capabilities responsibly.

## Aquarius AI Copilot Architecture Context

**Routing & Core Flow:**
- Next.js App Router drives UX through `app/(chat)/page.tsx` with guest auth gating
- `components/chat.tsx` wraps `useChat` with `DefaultChatTransport` for model injection
- `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` orchestrates streaming via `streamText` and registered tools
- Message shapes must align with `lib/types.ts` and `convertToUIMessages/generateUUID`

**Streaming & Artifacts:**
- UI streaming flows through `components/data-stream-provider.tsx` and `DataStreamHandler`
- Artifact tools (`createDocument`, `updateDocument`, etc.) defined in `lib/ai/tools/*`
- Persistence through `lib/artifacts/server.ts` and `lib/db/queries.ts`
- Resumable playback depends on Redis with graceful degradation

**Authentication & Persistence:**
- Drizzle schema in `lib/db/schema.ts` with typed helpers in `lib/db/queries.ts`
- Dual Credentials providers (guest + password) in `app/(auth)/auth.ts`
- Middleware auto-enrolls guests and enforces auth redirects
- Entitlements and rate limits via `lib/ai/entitlements.ts`

## Code Quality Standards (Ultracite Compliance)

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Never use `accessKey` or `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements
- Include meaningful alt text without "image", "picture", or "photo"
- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable with proper ARIA roles
- Always include `lang` attribute on html elements and `title` for SVGs/iframes
- Accompany mouse events with keyboard equivalents (`onKeyUp`/`onKeyDown`)

**React & TypeScript Best Practices:**
- Use arrow functions instead of function expressions
- Prefer `const` declarations and avoid `var`
- Use `===` and `!==` for comparisons
- Implement comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Use `export type` and `import type` for TypeScript types
- Avoid TypeScript enums, namespaces, and non-null assertions
- Use `as const` instead of literal type annotations

**Code Structure & Safety:**
- Follow single responsibility principle with modular components
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use semantic HTML elements instead of role attributes
- Avoid nested ternary expressions and complex conditional logic
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use `node:` protocol for Node.js builtin modules

- Databases: `MONGODB_URI`, `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_*` variables
- AI Services: `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Infrastructure: `KV_*` (Redis), `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_*` variables

**Security & Safety Priorities:**
- Implement sandboxed environments for computer-use operations
- Use proper input validation following Ultracite rules
- Enforce human-in-the-loop workflows for sensitive operations
- Follow principle of least privilege for API access
- Implement comprehensive error handling with `ChatSDKError` patterns

**Development Workflow:**
- Provide complete, runnable code with all dependencies
- Include detailed setup instructions and configuration
- Design for iterative development and maintenance
- Consider performance implications and token optimization
- Follow existing patterns in the Aquarius codebase

Always prioritize security, accessibility, and maintainability while leveraging cutting-edge AI capabilities responsibly. Ensure all code follows Ultracite standards and integrates seamlessly with the existing Aquarius AI Copilot architecture.
- Use pnpm for dependency management and scripts (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`).
- Prefer TypeScript App Router conventions: server routes in `app/**/route.ts`, client components marked with `"use client"`.
- Database interactions go through Drizzle helpers in `lib/db/queries.ts`; avoid raw SQL.
- Chat flows rely on `components/chat.tsx` and `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`; keep message shapes aligned with `lib/types.ts`.
- Authentication/session helpers live under `app/(auth)` and `lib/auth`; reuse them rather than recreating auth logic.
- For streaming and UI data, leverage providers in `components/data-stream-provider.tsx` and message utilities in `components/data-stream-handler.tsx`.
- When adding background jobs, secure cron endpoints with the `CRON_SECRET` bearer check and schedule jobs in `vercel.json`.
- Analytics are handled with `@vercel/analytics`; render the `<Analytics />` component in `app/layout.tsx` and avoid duplicating telemetry setups.
- Keep documentation for AI collaborators in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in sync with architectural changes.
- This project integrates with Vercelâ€™s Computer-Using Agent (CUA) workflows; ensure automated agents follow the existing patterns for streaming, auth, and deployment configuration.
