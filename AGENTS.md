Aquarius AI Copilot Onboarding
Architecture & Routing
Next.js App Router drives the UX: app/(chat)/page.tsx gates guest auth then renders <Chat /> plus <DataStreamHandler />.
components/chat.tsx wraps useChat with a DefaultChatTransport that injects selectedChatModel and visibility into /api/chat payloads.
app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts orchestrates streams via streamText, TokenLens usage merge, resumable contexts (createStreamId, getStreamContext), and registered tools.
Message shapes must align with lib/types.ts and convertToUIMessages/generateUUID in lib/utils.ts; update both sides together.
History endpoints (app/(chat)/api/history, components/sidebar-history.tsx) rely on cursor params starting_after/ending_before; preserve pagination helpers.
Streaming & Artifacts
UI streaming flows through components/data-stream-provider.tsx and DataStreamHandler, which expect data-* deltas to manage artifact metadata and completion state.
Artifact tool calls (createDocument, updateDocument, requestSuggestions, getWeather) are defined in lib/ai/tools/* and wired in the chat route; reuse schemas + documentHandlersByArtifactKind for persistence.
Artifact persistence and suggestion storage go through lib/artifacts/server.ts and lib/db/queries.ts (saveDocument, saveSuggestions); avoid bypassing these helpers.
Resumable playback depends on Redis (REDIS_URL) but the route already degrades gracefully—mirror the existing guard when extending.
lib/ai/prompts.ts controls system messaging (artifacts guidance, geo hints); keep prompt edits in sync with token usage tracking.
Persistence & Auth
Drizzle schema lives in lib/db/schema.ts; every write/read should use the typed helpers in lib/db/queries.ts so ChatSDKError handling stays consistent.
app/(auth)/auth.ts layers two Credentials providers (guest + password) and augments the session token with user.type; reuse this when adding auth flows.
middleware.ts auto-enrolls guests via /api/auth/guest and blocks authenticated users from /login or /register; new routes must respect these redirects.
Entitlements and rate limits derive from lib/ai/entitlements.ts + getMessageCountByUserId; consult them before exposing new message surfaces.
Document APIs (app/(chat)/api/document, /api/suggestions) enforce ownership; ensure any new mutations keep the same authorization pattern.
Ops, Testing & Tooling
Package scripts use pnpm: pnpm dev, pnpm build (runs tsx lib/db/migrate requiring POSTGRES_URL), pnpm lint (npx ultracite check), and pnpm test (Playwright with PLAYWRIGHT=True).
Tests under tests/ spin up mocked providers via lib/ai/models.mock.ts when isTestEnvironment is true; extend mocks instead of hitting live gateways.
Cron automation lives at app/api/cron/route.ts secured with CRON_SECRET and is scheduled through vercel.json (/api/cron); keep auth checks intact.
Deployment metadata: microfrontends.json configures the Vercel group and app/layout.tsx must continue rendering <Analytics /> for @vercel/analytics.
Observability hooks (instrumentation.ts, @vercel/otel) assume the service name ai-chatbot; reuse tracing setup for new spans/logs.
Automation & Safety
Follow docs/computer-use-guide.md for Computer-Using Agent loops (sandboxing, screenshot feedback, safety acknowledgements) whenever updating automation flows.
Model catalog + usage: lib/ai/providers.ts routes through Vercel AI Gateway and TokenLens caching; register new model IDs there and in lib/ai/models.ts.
Error responses should always throw/return ChatSDKError so fetchWithErrorHandlers and toast messaging behave; avoid naked Response.json for failures.
Sidebar/chat clients assume optimistic SWR invalidation via unstable_serialize(getChatHistoryPaginationKey) and updateChatVisibility; keep these mutation hooks wired.
Suggestions streaming emits data-suggestion events that DataStreamHandler forwards to artifact UIs; preserve event names when expanding metadata.
Middleware-friendly /ping endpoint is required for Playwright bootstrap

## Architecture Patterns

**Aquarius Copilot Structure**
- App Router flow: `app/(chat)/page.tsx` → guest auth → `components/chat.tsx` → `api/chat/route.ts`
- Streaming via `data-stream-provider.tsx` and `DataStreamHandler`
- Artifacts through `lib/ai/tools/*` with Redis-backed persistence
- Authentication via Drizzle schema and Clerk integration

**Code Organization**
- Modular separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle enforcement
- Structured data formats (JSON/XML) for clear boundaries
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout

**Security Implementation**
- Sandboxed environments for CUA operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Human-in-the-loop workflows for sensitive actions
- Principle of least privilege for API access

## Code Quality Standards (Ultracite Compliance)

**Accessibility Requirements**
- Never use `accessKey` or inappropriate `aria-hidden`
- Meaningful alt text without "image", "picture", "photo"
- Focusable interactive elements with proper ARIA roles
- Include `lang` attribute on HTML and `title` for SVG/iframes
- Keyboard equivalents for all mouse events

**TypeScript Best Practices**
- Arrow functions over function expressions
- `const` declarations, avoid `var`
- Strict equality (`===`, `!==`)
- Comprehensive try-catch error handling
- `import type` and `export type` for types
- Avoid enums, namespaces, non-null assertions
- Use `as const` over literal type annotations

**Code Structure**
- Semantic HTML over role attributes
- No nested ternary expressions
- JSDoc comments for complex functions
- `node:` protocol for Node.js builtins
- Proper input validation patterns

## Environment Configuration

**Authentication**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY
```

**Databases**
```
MONGODB_URI
